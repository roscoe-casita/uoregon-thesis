The set of all hypernets represents the traversal of all hypergraphs over time. Thus the set of all hypernets represents all programs that can be interpreted. A difficult subject, as an instance of a hypernet is the running of the program over time, with a subset of all hypernets representing all possible paths. This is the equivalent of building a non-deterministic simulator in a deterministic environment. Exponential in nature the runtime grows beyond exponential into undecidable. Thus some instances of hypernets have been decided and actualized to produce some views into hypergraphs in this paper. Hypergraphs themselves are difficult to project in 2D and 3D.
