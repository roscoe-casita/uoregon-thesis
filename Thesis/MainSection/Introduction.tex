Hypergraph implementations have modeled real life systems with material gains in performance over graph representations of the same problems. Odometers serve as an alternative representation of hyperedges in a hypergraph from the traditional incident matrix. The traversal of hyperedges in a hypergraph using an odometer and incrementing function is shown to be similar to traversing a Hilbert curve through a $N^\infty$ dimensional Hilbert space.

\section{Introduction}
Hypergraphs are composed of a set of vertexes and hyperedges $HG = (v, he)$ commonly denoted in matrix format show below. Each column represents a nodeâ€™s set of hyperedges. Each row represents a set of nodes in a hyperedge. The sample hypergraph presented as both nodes linked by hyperedges and hyperedges linked by nodes in the subsequent pictures. Displaying high dimensionality objects such as hypergraphs is a complex problem with active ongoing research in the area..

\section{Concepts}

\indent The presented hypergraph model supports conversion from an odometer to hyperedge or hyperedge to odometer in one function call. Traditionally all hyperedges in a hypergraph are explicitly declared and stored in memory or disk. \\

This model can explore super dense hypergraphs: $2^N$, $N^N$ even $N^M$ hyperedges that standard matrix hypergraph models cannot represent. These hypergraphs share the common characteristic that they must be explored algorithmically. This image demonstrates a single odometer to hyperedge conversion via arbitrary hypergraph using the given definitions.\\

\begin{lstlisting}
hypergraph =makeHyperGraph(sorted(set("Hello World!")))

odometer = getOdometer(hypergraph, "Hello World!")

hyperedge = getHyperEdge(hypergraph,odometer)

(vector_of_things,address_lookup) = hypergraph
\end{lstlisting}
