\abstract{		This paper introduces the hypergraph traversal problem along with the known solutions: Naive, Branch and bound, Polynomial space (recursive). The paper introduces a polynomial space (serial) version of the algorithm. Odometers are introduced as an key type for hypergraphs and detailed for future reference. A rigorous test system is used to ensure completeness. Lastly future research directions are examined. }
